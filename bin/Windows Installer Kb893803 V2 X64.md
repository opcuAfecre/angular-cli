Windows Installer is a component of your Windows operating system that provides a standard foundation for installing and uninstalling software. Software manufacturers can create their product setup to use the Windows Installer to make software installation, maintenance, and uninstallation straightforward and easy.
 
If you are running a 64-bit version of Windows Server 2003 or of Windows XP, you may need to update your Windows Installer to version 3.1 v2 (3.1.4000.2435), which is available as a redistributable package from Microsoft. This package contains the binary for the Msi.dll file that is updated to fix some issues with the Windows Installer service.
